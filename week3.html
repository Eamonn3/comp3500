                <h2>Project: Cross-platform Mobile Game</h1>
                <p>Once our group settled we began to discuss the future direction of the project. During this phase I found that we were not getting anywhere with project and I felt that the best thing to do would be to immediately write code. However, clearly a detailed plan is very useful as a central point of reference and so that everyone is on the same page. We had issues deciding on what kind of game we would all be happy working on. We eventually decided to all think of potential ideas and present them in our first meeting next week.</p>
                <p>We also had issues dividing team member roles up. We all came from a technical background so we would all be working on the code. We also decided to work on a game because we all felt it would be a fun project to work on and is something that interests us. As result we all wanted to have some input in the design of our game and the art direction.</p>
                <p>I felt that little progress was done in the way of the progression of the project this week. However, these topics that we discussed were important in both deciding the details of the project but also getting to know my team mates.</p>

                <p>When writing a thorough plan for the game problems arose. Firstly, it was difficult for me to perfectly communicate what I had envisioned for the game. Secondly, it is not possible to fully incorporate everyones ideas to form a cohesive end product. Some ideas may be perfectly valid individually but may not mesh with other peoples ideas.</p>

                <p>I also researched technologies that could be used to fulfil our goal of creating a cross platform mobile game. A fully featured game engine such as Unity is advantageous in allowing for rapid development since the engine comes with common functionality built in. However, I find that this ease of development comes with a loss of control over the fine details. For this reason, as a team, we have chosen to go with a library called SDL and roll out our on game engine. Whether this trade off is worth it remains to be seen.</p>
                <p>We found it very difficult to all start the project at the same time. The game could only be started from one spot and all the initial tasks are heavily interconnected. This meant that we could not divide up work and get going on the project right away. Finally, we decided to each work individually on prototypes to test out ideas and see if they would work.</p>

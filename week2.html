                <p>To me a system is made up of individual components and systems thinking is thinking about the interaction of each component. This contrasts to analytical thinking which deals with the detailed workings of the individual component. The lecture gave examples of feedback loops. This shows how a system does not exist within a vacuum and there are many interdependent parts.</p>
                <p>To give a concrete example, I think of a phone as a system. To design a mobile processor will certainly involve analytical thinking however, a systems thinking point of view is equally as critical to achieve success. A phone processor needs to be low power because the battery (another component within the system) is small. It also does not need to be as powerful as a desktop processor because the use of a phone is different. To pull apart a phone you cannot look at the battery alone to understand why it is small.</p>

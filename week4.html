                <h1 class="week4">Week 4 - Presented Game Ideas</h1>
                <p>When thinking of game ideas I found that there were a number of difficult to balance variables that had to be balanced. These were:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Fun for me/team to play</li>
                    <li>Fun for a general consumer to play</li>
                    <li>Fun to work on</li>
                    <li>Commercial viability</li>
                    <li>Possible to execute on within given constraints</li>
                    <li>Suitable as a tech-launcher project</li>
                    <li>The game works within a mobile context</li>
                </ul>
                <p>I quickly realised that it would be impossible to perfectly achieve all of these goals.</p>
                <p>The basic idea of my proposed project: You control a small ship scrolling through a randomly generated space level. Taping and holding on the left side of the screen will engage the left thruster, causing the ship to veer left, and vies-versa for tapping on the right side of the screen. Tapping both sides of the screen at the same time will propel the ship straight ahead. Fuel is limited so the gravitation pull of surrounding planets has to be used to slingshot your ship from planet to planet. In the randomly generated levels there are enemies that can be killed using weapons found through the level. The weapons are not controlled directly e.g. a homing missile system that shoots at enemies if they get close. If you are killed you start from the beginning and all upgrades are lost. However, missions can be completed that permanently upgrade your ship so a sense of progression is still achieved.</p>
                <p>See below for some sketches of the game</p>

                <img src="gameplay2.jpg" />
                <img src="gameplay3.jpg" />
                <p>We all voted on our preferences for which ideas we liked the most and eventually decided on the game idea that I proposed. Coming up with and presenting game ideas can be viewed as not directly contributing to the to the project. Although, I feel that this idea worked because we all got to have some input in what the general idea and scope of the game would be.</p>
                <p>We also had trouble on deciding on what the scope of project should be defined to. Without a previous frame of reference I think it is easy to overestimate our ability and after the year not have a complete end product. For this reason we tried to limit the scope as much as possible and have extra features that can be implemented if we do complete more than expected within the year.</p>

                <p>This course focuses more on self directed learning rather than the traditional method of teacher presented ideas and concepts. I think this is a good thing as I believe that the majority of learning that is done throughout life is self directed. This course also seems to focus on teaching non-academic skills such as teamwork similar to the aim of courses such as COMP3120 - Managing Software Development. I find that I mostly enjoy working by myself as this allows me to have complete control over every detail and the focus can be purely on the project rather than team coordination. However, I see the benefit of team work as it can allow for new ideas to be explored collaboratively and to learn from other people.</p>
                <p>Software engineering is a fundamentally social activity and so from a personal development perspective, team projects are important. The course is also the first I have done where we are expected to develop a relatively large scale system. Previously courses have just required small to medium sized projects for assignments. The year long timescale of the course will hopefully allow me to gain experience the architectural and software engineering side of software development.</p>

                <p>Most courses I have studied teach hard technical skills. Some courses, such as Managing Software Development (COMP3120), teach softer skills. However, there has not been much of a gap between these two areas of study. This link between technical and non-technical courses as well as a connection between all courses I undertake during my degree (computer science or otherwise) I hope to understand better because of Systems Engineering.</p>
